# ML-Driven Auto-Scaling for Connected Cars in Edge Computing with K8s/K3s

## Overview
This project implements **machine learning-based auto-scaling** for connected car environments in edge computing. Using **Kubernetes (K8s)** and **K3s** to manage resources, it leverages **digital twins** to simulate real-world conditions, allowing precise testing and optimization of the auto-scaling model. The project aims to dynamically manage resources based on vehicle traffic and data generation rates, ensuring efficient edge resource usage in connected car systems.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning-Based Auto-Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts server resources based on predictive models.
- **Edge Computing for Connected Cars**: Optimized for edge networks to support high-volume data in real-time.
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Simulates real-world conditions for accurate testing and performance tuning.
- **K8s & K3s Compatibility**: Supports both full-scale Kubernetes and lightweight K3s for versatile deployment.
